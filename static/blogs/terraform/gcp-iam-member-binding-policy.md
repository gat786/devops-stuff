### GCP IAM Members, Bindings and Policies

I was recently working on GCP IAM policies and this change was gonna impact the
entire organisations IAM policies at a larger level. I found it really confusing 
at a level that I needed to take a step back and understand the very basics to
the core before doing any modifications to the infrastructure.

This lead me to thing, I should write a blog about it, so here it goes.

The code that I am playing around in this repository can be seen [here](https://github.com/gat786/iam-member-policies)
